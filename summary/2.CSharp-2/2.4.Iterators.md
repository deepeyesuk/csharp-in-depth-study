# Iterators

`IEnumerable` has always had support for consumption in the form of the foreach statement

C# 2 extended that to its new-to-.NET-2 generic counter-part `IEnumerable<T>`

### Iterator

An iterator is a method or property implemented with an iterator block, which is in turn just a block of code using the yield return or yield break statements

Iterator blocks implement the following interfaces

* IEnumerable
* IEnumerable<T> 
* IEnumerator
* IEnumerator<T> 
  
What is yield return?
  
The yield return statements provide values for the returned sequence

```csharp
static IEnumerable<int> CreateSimpleIterator()
{
  yield return 10;
  for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) 
  {
    yield return i; 
  }
  yield return 20; 
}
                        
foreach (int value in CreateSimpleIterator())
{
    Console.WriteLine(value);
}

// That loop will print the following output:
10 
0 
1 
2 
20
```

### Lazy execution

Lazy execution, or lazy evaluation, was invented as part of lambda calculus

Execute code only when you need the value that it’ll compute
                        
* An IEnumerable is a sequence that can be iterated over, 
* whereas an IEnumerator is like a cursor within a sequence

```csharp
IEnumerable<int> enumerable = CreateSimpleIterator(); 
using (IEnumerator<int> enumerator = enumerable.GetEnumerator())
{
  while (enumerator.MoveNext()) 
  {
    int value = enumerator.Current;
    Console.WriteLine(value);
  }
}
```

When CreateSimpleIterator() is called, none of the method body is executed

If you put a breakpoint on the first line (yield return 10) and step through the code, you won’t hit the breakpoint when you call the method. You won’t hit the break- point when you call GetEnumerator(), either. The method body starts executing only when MoveNext() is called
                      
                        
### The importance of being lazy

```csharp
static IEnumerable<int> Fibonacci()
{
  int current = 0;
  int next = 1;
  while (true)
  {
      yield return current;
      int oldCurrent = current;
      current = next;
      next = next + oldCurrent;
  } 
}  

static void Main()
{
  foreach (var value in Fibonacci())
  {
    Console.WriteLine(value);
    if (value > 1000)
    {
      break; 
    }
  } 
}
```
