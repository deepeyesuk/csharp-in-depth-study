# 2.3. Simplified Delegate Creation

What is a delegate? 

* "encapsulate a piece of code so that it can be passed around and executed as necessary in a type-safe fashion in terms of the return type and parameters"

A method group 

* refers to one or more methods with the same name
* `Console.WriteLine("hello");` Console.WriteLine is a method group

C# 2 introduced method group conversion

```csharp
private void HandleButtonClick(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    Console.WriteLine(e.ToString());
}


// C# 1
var handler = new EventHandler(HandleButtonClick);

// C# 2
var handler = HandleButtonClick

```
