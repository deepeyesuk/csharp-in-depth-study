# Survival of the Sharpest

## An evolving language

### A helpful type system at large and small scales

The more precisely you can specify the shape of the data your code accepts and returns, the more the compiler can help you avoid mistakes.

```csharp
// C# 1 
public class Bookshelf
{
    public IEnumerable Books { get { ... } }
}



// generics from C# 2
// more fine-grained type control
public class Bookshelf
{
    public IEnumerable<Book> Books { get { ... } } }
}
```

C# 2 also brought nullable value types

```charp
string Method(string x, string? y)
```

Anonymous types are primarily used within LINQ queries

C# 7 introduced tuples: value types that effectively act to collect variables together.

```csharp
var book = (title: "Lost in the Snow", author: "Holly Webb");
Console.WriteLine(book.title);
```

C# 8
