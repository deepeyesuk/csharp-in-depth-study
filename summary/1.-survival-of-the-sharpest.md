# Survival of the Sharpest

## An evolving language

### A helpful type system at large and small scales

The more precisely you can specify the shape of the data your code accepts and returns, the more the compiler can help you avoid mistakes.

```csharp
// C# 1 
public class Bookshelf
{
    public IEnumerable Books { get { ... } }
}



// generics from C# 2
// more fine-grained type control
public class Bookshelf
{
    public IEnumerable<Book> Books { get { ... } } }
}
```
