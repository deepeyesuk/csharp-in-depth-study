# Survival of the Sharpest

## An evolving language

### 1. A helpful type system at large and small scales

The more precisely you can specify the shape of the data your code accepts and returns, the more the compiler can help you avoid mistakes.

```csharp
// C# 1 
public class Bookshelf
{
    public IEnumerable Books { get { ... } }
}



// generics from C# 2
// more fine-grained type control
public class Bookshelf
{
    public IEnumerable<Book> Books { get { ... } } }
}
```

// C# 2 also brought nullable value types


// C# 3 introduced anonymous types and implicitly typed local variables (var).
Anonymous types are primarily used within LINQ queries
Anonymous types help only within a single block of code; for example, you can’t use them as method parameters or return types. 

```csharp
var book = new { Title = "Lost in the Snow", Author = "Holly Webb" };
string title = book.Title;
string author = book.Author;
```

```csharp
// Linq query
private void RunTest()
{
    var v = new[] {
        new { Name="Lee", Age=33, Phone="02-111-1111" },
        new { Name="Kim", Age=25, Phone="02-222-2222" },
        new { Name="Park", Age=37, Phone="02-333-3333" },
    };

    // LINQ Select를 이용해 Name과 Age만 갖는 새 익명타입 객체들을 리턴.
    var list = v.Where(p => p.Age >= 30).Select(p => new { p.Name, p.Age });
    foreach (var a in list)
    {
        Debug.WriteLine(a.Name + a.Age);
    }
}
```

```csharp
// Explicit typing
Dictionary<string, string> map1 = new Dictionary<string, string>();
// Implicit typing
var map2 = new Dictionary<string, string>();
```

// C# 7 gave us the ability to tell the compiler that a user-defined struct should be immutable using readonly struct declarations
C# 7 introduced tuples: value types that effectively act to collect variables together.
One of their benefits(tuple) is that they can be used as method parameters and return types. 

```csharp
var book = (title: "Lost in the Snow", author: "Holly Webb");
Console.WriteLine(book.title);
```

// C# 8 include nullable reference types(either as a return value, a parameter, or just a local variable)
 
 ```charp
string Method(string x, string? y)
```


### 2. Ever more concise code
One of the recurring themes within new features of C# has been the ability to let you express your ideas in ways that are increasingly concise

#### Construction and initialization
Delegates have probably evolved the most and in multiple stages. 

```csharp
// c#1
button.Click += new EventHandler(HandleButtonClick);

// C# 2 introduced method group conversions and anonymous methods. 
button.Click += HandleButtonClick;
button.Click += delegate { MessageBox.Show("Clicked!"); };

// C# 3 provided us with lambda expressions
button.Click += (sender, args) => MessageBox.Show("Clicked!");
```

benefits for initialization in the form of object initializers and collection initializers. 
```csharp

var customer = new Customer();
customer.Name = "Jon";
customer.Address = "UK";
var item1 = new OrderItem();
item1.ItemId = "abcd123";
item1.Quantity = 1;
var item2 = new OrderItem();
item2.ItemId = "fghi456";
item2.Quantity = 2;
var order = new Order();
order.OrderId = "xyz";
order.Customer = customer;
order.Items.Add(item1);
order.Items.Add(item2);

// The object and collection initializers introduced in C# 3 make this so much clearer
var order = new Order
{
    OrderId = "xyz",
    Customer = new Customer { Name = "Jon", Address = "UK" },
    Items =
    {
        new OrderItem { ItemId = "abcd123", Quantity = 1 },
        new OrderItem { ItemId = "fghi456", Quantity = 2 }
    }
};
```

#### Method and Property declarations
One of the most obvious examples of simplification is through automatically implemented properties.

```csharp
// C# 1
private string name;
public string Name
{
    get { return name; }
    set { name = value; }
}

// C# 3
public string Name { get; set; }
```

C# 6 introduced expression-bodied members that remove more ceremony.
```csharp
// Prior to C# 6
public int Count { get { return list.Count; } }
public IEnumerator<string> GetEnumerator()
{
    return list.GetEnumerator();
}

// C# 6
public int Count => list.Count;
public IEnumerator<string> GetEnumerator() => list.GetEnumerator();
```

#### String Handling
- C# 5 introduced caller information attributes
메서드의 매개변수에 사용되면 매서드의 호출자이름/ 호출자메서드가 정의된 소스파일 경로/ 소스파일내 행번호를 알 수 있음
- C# 6 introduced the nameof operator
C# 6.0의 nameof 연산자는 Type이나 메서드, 속성 등의 이름을 리턴하는 것으로 이러한 명칭들을 하드코딩하지 않게 하는 이점이 있음
- C# 6 also introduced interpolated string literals

### 3. Simpe Data access with Linq 
LINQ didn’t just give C# developers new tools; it encouraged us to think about data transformations in a new way based on functional programming. This affects more than data access. LINQ provided the initial impetus to take on more functional ideas, but many C# developers have embraced those ideas and taken them further.

### 4. Asynchrony
C# 5 brought a new level of clarity to programming asynchrony in a main- stream language with a feature usually referred to as async/await. 

```csharp
private async Task UpdateStatus() {

    /// Starts two operations concurrently
    Task<Weather> weatherTask = GetWeatherAsync();
    Task<EmailStatus> emailTask = GetEmailStatusAsync();
    
    // Asynchronously waits for thme to complete
    Weather weather = await weatherTask;
    EmailStatus email = await emailTask;
    
    // updates the userinterface
    weather.Text = weather.Description; 
    inboxLable.Text = email.InboxCount.ToString();
    
   }
   ```


### 5. Balancing efficiency and complexity (efficient but can be complexed )
Efficiency Vs. Complexity
Asynchrony helps address performance in some situations,
Read-only structs and a much larger surface area for ref features help to avoid redundant copying. 
The Span<T> feature present in modern frameworks and supported by ref-like struct types reduces unnecessary allocation and garbage collection
My hope is that these features will be used in moderation

    
### 6. Evolution at speed: Using minor versions
Volatility in language features can be disconcerting
C# compiler defaults to using the earliest minor version of the latest major version it supports. If you use a C# 7 compiler and don’t specify any lan- guage version, it will restrict you to C# 7.0 by default. If you want to use a later minor version, you need to specify that in your project file and opt into the new features.
